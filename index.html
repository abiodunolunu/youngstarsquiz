                        A well-dressed young man, Abiodun, entered a big textile shop one evening. He was able to draw the
                        attention of the salesmen who thought him rich and likely to make heavy purchases. He was shown
                        the superior varieties of suit lengths and sarees. But after casually examining them, he kept
                        moving to the next section, where readymade goods were being sold and further on to the hosiery
                        section. By them, the salesmen had begun to doubt his intentions and drew the attention of the
                        manager. The manager asked him what exactly he wanted and he replied that he wanted courteous
                        treatment. He explained that he had come to the same shop in casual dress that morning and drawn
                        little attention. His pride was hurt and he wanted to assert himself. He had come in good dress
                        only to get decent treatment, not for getting any textiles. He left without making any purchase.
